         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE French King's Lamentation, For the LOSS of his Great GENERAL, the DUKE OF LUXEMBURG. A POEM.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>HA! what no Luck; have I my Fortune Run</l>
               <l>Quite out of Breath; what? <hi>Luxemburg</hi> too gone?</l>
               <l>My Guilded Lillys now begin to Fade,</l>
               <l>I find my burning and my Plund'ring Trade,</l>
               <l>Are at a ſtand, muſt I no further go,</l>
               <l>I now may Flutter but no longer Crow.</l>
               <l>A ſtop to my ambition now I ſee,</l>
               <l>Dull is the Sword, whetted by Tyranny.</l>
               <l>A while it may deſtroy, but ſtill at laſt,</l>
               <l>Its blunted Edge will fail and his hopes blaſt,</l>
               <l>That uſeth it, when a more Active Arm</l>
               <l>With Juſtice comes to give a fierce Allarm.</l>
               <l>Brings Combatants, as Equal to the Field,</l>
               <l>Whilſt Sheltered Nations Fight behind His Shield.</l>
               <l>I often Brav'd all Europe when but Weak,</l>
               <l>But now one comes who do's in Thunder Speak.</l>
               <l>I think a Ladys Chamber ſafer far,</l>
               <l>Than the Grim Face of ſuch a Dangerous War,</l>
               <l>Whilſt <hi>Luxemburg</hi> by <hi>Conjuration</hi> Drove,</l>
               <l>On my Deſigns, and few againſt me ſtrove,</l>
               <l>My Gold was Currant then to Buy a Town,</l>
               <l>And that kept up my Tottering Renown.</l>
               <l>My Brother <hi>Turk</hi> was Gull'd then with my Fame,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Mahomet</hi> did me his Champion Claim,</l>
               <l>To Ruin <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and Plant his Name.</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:104414:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <l>But now I Stagger, my Great General,</l>
               <l>Tript up by Death, Trips me up in his Fall.</l>
               <l>So when a Mountains Top, Looſned by Rain,</l>
               <l>Unnerv'd, comes Ruſhing down into a Plain.</l>
               <l>The Shelter'd <hi>Cedar</hi> it finds there, it Cruſhes,</l>
               <l>And Lays its Top among the Humble Buſhes.</l>
               <l>I who Did Boaſt, I for my Glory Fought,</l>
               <l>By ſuch a Loſs, am to my Wits-End brought.</l>
               <l>I Priſon'd him once for a Witch 'tis True,</l>
               <l>O're-rul'd by <hi>Miſs,</hi> and by my Flatt'ring Crew,</l>
               <l>But now what would I give, it were not done.</l>
               <l>For in his Loſs, my Kingdoms Bulwarks's gone.</l>
               <l>Now after great Expence, and Loſs of Blood,</l>
               <l>With which I've Crimſon'd <hi>Europe</hi> in a Flood.</l>
               <l>I ſhall be once more Painted Spewing Towns,</l>
               <l>And fear at every <hi>Poſt-Horn,</hi> Fortunes Frowns.</l>
               <l>Well what muſt be, muſt be too late I find,</l>
               <l>I wiſh in time, I had been far more kind,</l>
               <l>And not my Subjects Ruin long Deſign'd,</l>
               <l>The Proteſtants I Baniſh'd Tortur'd Rack'd,</l>
               <l>The Countreys Ruin'd and the Citys Sack'd.</l>
               <l>The Leagues I Broke, and Injurys I have done,</l>
               <l>Like rapid torrents in my mind now run,</l>
               <l>And Rattle in my Ear, I m near undone.</l>
               <l>My Wealth is Waſted, and my People Poor,</l>
               <l>I have too long run upon Fortunes Score.</l>
               <l>In vain I ſtrove t'outwind thoſe that Purſue,</l>
               <l>Who fear not War, nor Start at Dangers new.</l>
               <l>O I am Sick, my Ague Fit Returns,</l>
               <l>By Fits it Strives, and by Fits it Burns,</l>
               <l>My <hi>Fiſtulo,</hi> too brings tormenting pain,</l>
               <l>And againſt Fate I ſee I ſtrive in vain.</l>
               <l>The loſs of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> my hopes do Blaſt,</l>
               <l>That totters which I once thought to hold faſt.</l>
               <l>And tells me I muſt honeſt prove at laſt.</l>
               <l>What I unjuſtly got muſt rendred be,</l>
               <l>If any thing I'de ſave or good days ſee.</l>
